# Comparative Study of Inference Methods for Bayesian Nonnegative Matrix Factorisation
This project contains an implementation of the Bayesian non-negative matrix factorisation and tri-factorisation models presented in the paper [**Comparative Study of Inference Methods for Bayesian Nonnegative Matrix Factorisation**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.05147), published at the European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (ECML PKDD 2017). For both models we implement four different inference methods (Gibbs sampling, variational Bayesian inference, iterated conditional modes, and non-probabilistic inference), and for the Bayesian models we also provide automatic model selection (using the automatic relevance determination prior). We furthermore provide all datasets used (including the preprocessing scripts), and Python scripts for experiments.

#### Paper abstract
In this paper, we study the trade-offs of different inference approaches for Bayesian matrix factorisation methods, which are com- monly used for predicting missing values, and for finding patterns in the data. In particular, we consider Bayesian nonnegative variants of matrix factorisation and tri-factorisation, and compare non-probabilistic infer- ence, Gibbs sampling, variational Bayesian inference, and a maximum- a-posteriori approach. The variational approach is new for the Bayesian nonnegative models. We compare their convergence, and robustness to noise and sparsity of the data, on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Furthermore, we extend the models with the Bayesian automatic rele- vance determination prior, allowing the models to perform automatic model selection, and demonstrate its efficiency.

## Installation 
If you wish to use the matrix factorisation models, or replicate the experiments, follow these steps. Please ensure you have Python 2.7 (3 is currently not supported). 
1. Clone the project to your computer, by running `git clone https://github.com/ThomasBrouwer/BNMTF_ARD.git` in your command line.
2. In your Python script, add the project to your system path using the following lines.  
   
   ``` 
   project_location = "/path/to/folder/containing/project/"
   import sys
   sys.path.append(project_location) 
   ```
   For example, if the path to the project is `/johndoe/projects/BNMTF_ARD/`, use `project_location = /johndoe/projects/`. 
   If you intend to rerun some of the paper's experiments, those scripts automatically add the correct path.
3. You may also need to add an empty file in `/johndoe/projects/` called `__init__.py`.
4. You can now import the models in your code, e.g.
```
from BNMTF_ARD.code.models.nmf_np import nmf_np
model = nmf_np(R=numpy.ones((4,3)), M=numpy.ones((4,3)), K=2)
model.initialise()
model.run(iterations=10)
```

## Examples
You can find good examples of the models running on data in the [convergence experiment on the toy data](./experiments/experiments_toy/convergence/), e.g. [nonnegative matrix factorisation with Gibbs sampling](./experiments/experiments_toy/convergence/nmf_gibbs.py).
